Abstract

   This document describes the conventions for using the SHAKE family of
   hash functions in the Internet X.509 PKI as one-way hash functions
   and with the DSA, ECDSA and EdDSA signature algorithm; the
   conventions for the associated subject public keys are also
   described.  Digital signatures are used to sign messages,
   certificates and CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists).

1.  Introduction

2.  Algorithm support

   This section describes cryptographic algorithms which may be used
   with the Internet X.509 Certificate and CRL profile [RFC5280].  This
   section describes one-way hash functions and digital signature
   algorithms which may be used to sign certificates and CRLs, and
   identifies OIDs (Object Identifiers) for public keys contained in a
   certificate.

2.1.  SHAKE One-Way Hash Functions

   The SHA-3 family of one-way hash functions is specified in [SHA3] In
   the SHA-3 family, two extendable-output functions, called SHAKE128
   and SHAKE256 are defined.  Four hash functions, SHA3-224, SHA3-256,
   SHA3-384, and SHA3-512 are also defined but are out of scope for this
   document.  The output lengths, in bits, of the SHAAKE hash functions
   is defined by the parameter d.  The corresponding collision and
   preimage resistance security levels for SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 are
   respectively min(d/2,128) and min(d,128) and min(d/2,128) and

   min(d,128).  The OIDs (Object Identifiers) for these two hash
   functions are as follows:

      id-shake128 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { }

      id-shake256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { }

   EDNOTE: More here.

      id-eddsa-with-shake128 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { }

      id-eddsa-with-shake256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { }

2.3.  Public Keys

   The conventions for RSA, DSA, ECDSA and EdDSA public keys are as
   specified in [RFC3279], [RFC5480] and [I-D.josefsson-pkix-eddsa].

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is kindly requested to register two OIDs in the SMI Security for
   PKIX Module Identifier registry for the ASN.1 modules found in
   Appendix A.  The description is as follows:
