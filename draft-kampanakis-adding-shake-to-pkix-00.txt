1.  Introduction

   EDNOTE: More here.

2.  Algorithm support

   This section describes several cryptographic algorithms which may be
   used with the Internet X.509 Certificate and CRL profile [RFC5280].
   This section describes 2 one-way hash functions and digital signature
   algorithms using these functions, which may be used to sign
   certificates and CRLs, and identifies OIDs (Object Identifiers) for
   public keys contained in certificates.

2.1.  SHAKE One-Way Hash Functions

   The SHA-3 family of one-way hash functions is specified in [SHA3] In
   the SHA-3 family, two extendable-output functions, called SHAKE128
   and SHAKE256 are defined.  Four hash functions, SHA3-224, SHA3-256,
   SHA3-384, and SHA3-512 are also defined but are out of scope for this
   document.  The output lengths, in bits, of the SHAKE hash functions
   is defined by the parameter d.  The corresponding collision and
   preimage resistance security levels for SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 are
   respectively min(d/2,128) and min(d,128) and min(d/2,128) and
   min(d,128).  The OIDs (Object Identifiers) for these two hash
   functions are as follows:

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title               October 2017


id-shake128 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu-t(2)
                                country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3)
                                nistalgorithm(4) hashalgs(2) 11 }



id-shake256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu-t(2)
                        country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3)
                        nistalgorithm(4) hashalgs(2) 12 }

   The output length, d, is always 256 and 512 bits for SHAKE128 and
   SHAKE256 respectively in this specification.

2.2.  Signature Algorithms

2.2.1.  RSA with SHAKE

   EDNOTE: To be discussed by the WG if RSA with SHAKE is something to
   be covered.



   shake128WithRSAEncryption  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { }



   shake256withRSAEncryption OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { }

2.2.2.  DSA with SHAKE

   The DSA is defined in the Digital Signature Standard (DSS)
   [FIPS186-4].  DSA is fully described in [FIPS186-3].  When SHAKE128
   is used, the OID is:

  id-dsa-with-shake128 OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { joint-iso-ccitt(2)
                    country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3)
                    algorithms(4) id-dsa-with-shake128(3) x }

   When SHAKE256 is used, the OID is:

id-dsa-with-shake256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { joint-iso-ccitt(2)
                  country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3) algorithms(4)
                  id-dsa-with-shake256(3) x }

   When the id-dsa-with-shake224 or id-dsa-with-shake256 algorithm
   identifier appears in the algorithm field as an AlgorithmIdentifier,
   the encoding SHALL omit the parameters field.  That is, the

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title               October 2017


   AlgorithmIdentifier SHALL be a SEQUENCE of one component, the OID id-
   dsa-with-shake128 or id-dsa-with-shake256.

   Encoding rules for DSA signature values are specified in [RFC3279].

   Conforming CA implementations that generate DSA signatures for
   certificates or CRLs MUST generate such DSA signatures in accordance
   with all the requirements in Section 4 in [FIPS186-4].  The lengths
   of p and q must be at least 2048 and 224 bits respectively.

2.2.3.  ECDSA with SHAKE

   The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is defined in
   "Public Key Cryptography for the Financial Services Industry: The
   Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Standard (ECDSA)" [X9.62].  The
   ASN.1 OIDs used to specify that an ECDSA signature was generated
   using SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 respectively:



id-ecdsa-with-shake128 OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { joint-iso-ccitt(2)
                        country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3) algorithms(4)
                        id-ecdsa-with-shake128(3) x }



id-ecdsa-with-shake256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { joint-iso-ccitt(2)
                        country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3) algorithms(4)
                        id-ecdsa-with-shake256(3) x }

   When the ecdsa-with-SHAKE128 or ecdsa-with-SHAKE256, algorithm
   identifier appears in the algorithm field as an AlgorithmIdentifier,
   the encoding MUST omit the parameters field.  That is, the
   AlgorithmIdentifier SHALL be a SEQUENCE of one component, the OID
   ecdsa-with-SHAKE128 or ecdsa-with-SHAKE256.

   Conforming CA implementations MUST specify the hash algorithm
   explicitly using the OIDs specified above when encoding ECDSA/SHAKE
   signatures in certificates and CRLs.

   Conforming client implementations that process ECDSA signatures with
   any of the SHAKE hash algorithms when processing certificates and
   CRLs MUST recognize the corresponding OIDs specified above.

   Encoding rules for ECDSA signature values are specified in [RFC3279],
   Section 2.2.3, and [RFC5480].

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title               October 2017


   Conforming CA implementations that generate ECDSA signatures in
   certificates or CRLs MUST generate such ECDSA signatures in
   accordance with all the requirements specified in Sections 7.2 and
   7.3 of [X9.62] or with all the requirements specified in
   Section 4.1.3 of [SEC1].

   Conforming CA implementations that ECDSA signatures in certificates
   or CRLs MAY generate such ECDSA signatures in accordance with all the
   requirements and recommendations in [X9.62] or [SEC1] if they have a
   stated policy that requires conformance to these standards.

   Those standards above did not specify SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 as hash
   algorithm options.  However, SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 with output length
   being 256 and 512 bits respectively are subtitutions for 256 and
   512-bit output hash algorithms such as SHA256 and SHA512.

2.2.4.  EdDSA with SHAKE

   EDNOTE: To be discussed with the WG as PureEdDSA as currently
   proposed in draft-ietf-curdle-cms-eddsa-signatures mandates the hash
   function.  It is up to the WG to use is going to use the Pre-hash
   version of EdDSA that could define the hash.



   id-eddsa-with-shake128 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { }



   id-eddsa-with-shake256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {  }

2.3.  Public Keys

   The conventions for RSA, DSA, ECDSA and EdDSA public keys are as
   specified in [RFC3279], [RFC5480] and [I-D.josefsson-pkix-eddsa].

   PKIX Module Identifier registry for the ASN.1 modules found in
