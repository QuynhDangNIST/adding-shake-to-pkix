	  <t>This section describes several cryptographic algorithms which may be used 
   with the Internet X.509 Certificate and CRL profile <xref target="RFC5280"/>.  This 
   section describes two one-way hash functions and digital signature 
   algorithms using these functions, which may be used to sign certificates and 
   CRLs, and identifies OIDs (Object Identifiers) for public keys contained in 
   certificates.</t>
      <section title="One-way Extensible-Output-Function SHAKEs">
        <t>The SHA-3 family of one-way hash functions is specified in <xref target="SHA3"/>. 
		In the SHA-3 family, two extendable-output functions, called SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 are 
		defined. Four hash functions, SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512 are also 
		defined but are out of scope for this document. The output lengths, in bits, of 
		the SHAKE hash functions is defined by the parameter d. The corresponding 
		collision and preimage resistance security levels for SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 
		are respectively min(d/2,128) and min(d,128) and min(d/2,256) and min(d,256). 
		The OIDs (Object Identifiers) for these two hash functions are as follows: </t>

       <t>When SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 is used as a hash function to hash a message before it gets signed in this specification,
       its output-length d must be either 256 or 512 respectively. In this case, the parameters
   MUST be present, and the parameter MUST contain an encoded

    <section title="Mask Generation Functions with SHAKE128 and SHAKE256">
    <t>The mask generation function is used with the RSASSA-PSS signature
   algorithm is MGF1 [P1v2.1].
   

   MGF1 is identified by the following object identifier:

      id-mgf1  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { pkcs-1 8 }

   The parameters field associated with id-mgf1 MUST have a
   hashAlgorithm value which identifies the hash function being used
   with MGF1.  This hash algorithm id MUST be id-shake128-len
   or id-shake256-len as specified in Section 3.1 above. 
   
   When id-shake128-len or id-shake256-len algorithm identifier is used, the ShakeOutputLen paramater must be
   (n -264) or (n - 520) respectively, where n is the RSA modulus. For example, when RSA modulus n is 2048 or 3072 bits,
   ShakeOutputLen must be 1784 or 2552 respectively. </t>

           When SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 is used as the hash algorithm, it must also be used as the mask generation function.
           
           When SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 is used, the paramater saltLength must be 32 or 64 respectively. </t>
